### I have implemented a system which send the tracking number via email to the user after filling out a service request or reporting an issue. 
![img.png](img.png)

### Data stuctures & Algorythms used 

### IssueStorage.cs (IssueStorage)
       BinarySearchTree<Issue> BstById: Organizes issues by ID for retrieval
       AVLTree<Issue> AvlByDate: Self-balancing tree for date-based sorting, ensuring insertions
       SortedSet<Issue> RedBlackByCategory: Red-Black tree for category-based sorting and filters
       PriorityQueue<Issue> HeapByPriority: Max-heap  for prioritizing issues by community votes
       ServiceRequestGraph Graph: Adjacency list graph for modeling issue dependency,  BFS traversal and MST
       GetMinimumSpanningTree:  algorithm implementation to find the minimum cost dependency network, optimiizing resource allocation for issues

### EventService.cs (EventService)
    SortedDictionary<DateTime, HashSet<Event>> EventsByDate: Organizes the events by date for  date lookup
    Dictionary<string, LinkedList<Event>> EventsByCategory: Group events by category using linked lists for ordered storage 
    HashSet<string> UniqueCategories: Stores unique category names for the dropdown
    HashSet<string> UniqueTags: Stores unique tag  for event tagging and suggestion
    Queue<Event> RecentEvents: FIFO -first in first out-  queue for tracking the most recent events - limited to  5 event 
    Stack<Event> FeaturedEvents: LIFO- last in first out- stack for featured events - limited to 3
    SortedDictionary<DateTime, HashSet<Event>> UpcomingEvents: Prioritizes upcoming events by date
    Dictionary<string, int> SearchHistory: Tracks search terms and how often for recommendations

### AnnouncementService.cs (AnnouncementService)
    Queue<Announcement> AnnouncementQueue: FIFO – first inn first out -  queue for managing announcements limited to  a maximum of 10
    Dictionary<string, List<Announcement>> AnnouncementsByCategory: Group the announcements 
    HashSet<string> UniqueCategories: Stores unique announcement category 
    SortedDictionary  List<Announcement>> AnnouncementsByPriority: Organize  announcements by priority level - high priority first  

### IssueStorage.cs (IssueStorage)
    LinkedList<Issue> ReportedIssues: Stores all the  report issues in a linked list for fast access and upvoting

### Event.cs
    List<string> Tags: Simple list for storing the many event tags

### Additional Notes
        my  project heavily uses advanced data structures to meet the POE demands  such as queues  stacks  dictionaries of many types  hash sets and linked lists
        SQLite is used for persistence, but in-memory data structures handle runtime operations.
        seeded data is added for the first start up then as admin and users perform actions, that data is sent to back end and then to the SQLite
        I have tried to maintain good coding practices throughout the development cycle 

    This program makes use of functional API calls. when a user submits via the contact form or reports an issue, a confromation email is sent to their gmail inbox. 
    For the report issue feature, the confirmation email shall contain the traccking number which can be used to follow up on the progress via the search bar located on the "Service Status" page

 * **************** AI DECLERATION ****************
   I Kashvir Sewpersad, the student , ST10257503,  hereby declare that I have made use of artificial intelligence in the creation of this project .
   The nature of my usage has primarily been for debugging issues, either logical or syntaxes based, improving functionality, assistance with Ui elements (front end) and overall improving the quality of the work I produce .
   I have also used AI to gain a better understanding of concepts, specifically the data structures and algorithms implemented,  AI was used heavily to get the email feature working which makes use of API to send email to the user.
   I copied the logic from the contact section over to the report issues section to implement the tracking functionality.
   I at no stage used AI to do the assignment, however I did use it to help me improve the features and implementation.
   Topics were researched prior to implementation and requesting AI assistance.
