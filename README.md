 *  -------------current issues --> TO BE FIXED IN PART 3 OR REMOVED IN PART 3 ------------
   
 *  the search event (not required as per poe  ) is not functioning correctly on local events
 *  the images (not required as per poe ) displaying on local events are not static at the moment --> i tried to have it so when a user loggs into the system they can see diffrent events each time, this has colided with the recomendation and i made a mess of it
 *  the admin cannont add an event if the active box is ticked ( not required as per poe )
 *  the recomendation algorithm does not display searched event right on top of the paage, it is displaying correctly, just not at the right position on the page 
 *
